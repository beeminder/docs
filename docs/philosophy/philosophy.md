#### What is Beeminder?  Why would I use it?
Is there anything you know you should do, you really do want to do, you know for certain you can do, yet that historically you don't do? 

If so, you might want to try beeminding it!

You'll tell us your goal and how often you want to do it.  Maybe it's running 3 times per week.  
You'll pledge to pay money if you don't do that thing.  You can start at $0 to get one freebee, or $5 if you want to feel the pressure immediately.
Update your Beeminder goal every time you do the thing.  If you don't do it often enough, we will charge you your pledge amount!

#### Wait, seriously?  *That's* your pricing model?

#### Can I send the money to a charity (or an anti-charity) instead?
With the [Beemium](https://www.beeminder.com/premium), you can opt to have 50% of derailment penalties donated to one of our preselected charities.

#### Don't people just lie about it?
Self-selection! If you were the type who would falsify your data to weasel out of paying what you pledged on your yellow brick road then you wouldâ€™ve rolled your eyes and walked away several paragraphs ago.

(Of course, some people _do_ lie about it, and we've written a [couple](http://blog.beeminder.com/cheating) [blog posts](http://blog.beeminder.com/chelsea) on the matter.  You can get back on the horse!  Keeping a Beeminder goal alive in which you never enter real, correct data is just a waste of time for everyone involved.)

#### Can I get the cool graphs and tracking and reminders without the commitment contracts and pledging?
Sure - but you have to pay for it.  The [Beemium](https://www.beeminder.com/premium) plan lets you set $0 pledge caps on your goals, so you can make every derailment free of charge.
