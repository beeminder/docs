#### What's the difference between the six different goal types?
Each of the six goal types works *slightly* differently from the other five, and each is best suited to a particular objective and requires data being entered a certain way.  Bee Plus [subscribers](https://www.beeminder.com/premium) also have access to custom goals, which expose more settings and enable super-tailored beehavior.

#### Why can I only pick between three goal types, when you just said there were six?
Odometer, Whittle Down, and Do Less goals are features of the [subscription](https://www.beeminder.com/premium) plans.

(Only 20% of all Beeminder goals fall in those 3 types.  If you really don’t want to subscribe and you really think you can’t live without one, contact support - we can almost always re-imagine the goal as a simple Do More!)

#### Can you give me a quick overview of each type?
Sure!
  * Do More: something I want to **do more** of, using **today's** amount, like “times I go to the gym”
  * Do Less: something I want to **do less** of, using **today's** amount, like “pounds of chicken nuggets eaten“
  * Odometer: something I want to **have more** of, using a **running total** amount, like “miles I’ve biked since installing this odometer on my bicycle three months ago”
  * Whittle Down: something I want to **have less** of, using a **running total** amount, like “emails currently in my inbox flagged as urgent”
  * Lose Weight: track your weight, which you want to decrease
  * Gain Weight: track your weight, which you want to increase
  * Custom: you can switch all the settings yourself and create an unholy mashup of the other 6 goal types
  
Each goal type is described in detail on the linked pages.

#### How do I change the goal rate I picked?
Using the 'Commit To' section of the 'Commitment' tab below the graph on the goal page, enter a new rate and click 'Update' to save changes.

The new rate will kick in in 7 days, even if it's making the goal harder!

#### What is 'safety buffer'?
The number of days before you will derail on your goal, if you do absolutely nothing else between now and then.

(TODO: this is technically not true for PPR)

#### Can I get rid of some of my safety buffer?  My goal has been too easy.
Absolutely.  Using the 'Safety Buffer' section of the 'Commitment' tab below the graph on the goal page, pick the number of days you'd like to jump down to, and click 'Update' to save changes.

This feature may be limited if your goal derailed the previous day, in order to prevent you from unintentionally triggering a second derailment.  Contact support and we can do it for you!

#### What if I only want to do my goal on weekdays?
Automatically-scheduled weekends off are a feature of the Bee Plus [subscription](https://www.beeminder.com/premium), which is the easiest way to manage that.

In general, Beeminder doesn’t care too much about what specific days you do work on; it only cares that you stay on or ahead of your road, on average.  If you fall behind the average pace, you will derail, no matter what day it is.

For example, let's say you have a goal to wake up at 8am five days a week, which you really only want to do on Monday-Friday -- but you don’t succeed on Thursday.  You’ll need to do it on Saturday or Sunday, or else you will derail over the weekend. (Which makes sense, of course, given that you didn’t meet your goal to wake up by 8am 5 days a week!)

And of course, you can manually schedule breaks every weekend to explicitly get yourself off the hook, regardless of the fact that you slept in on Thursday.  But you'll need to do that at least 7 days in advance (TODO: link akrasia horizon philosophy), as with all changes that make the goal easier.

#### What if I just want to do something once a quarter?  Or once a year?
Not a problem for Beeminder!  When creating the goal, make sure to tick the box to 'start with extra leeway' and set your goal rate accordingly.

Let's say I want to make a goal to attend one conference per quarter, but my next scheduled one isn't for another two months.  I'd make a Beeminder goal to attend 0.33 conferences per month and start my goal with 60 days of leeway.  That gives me some safety buffer, so my goal won't derail before I can attend my first conference.  After I attend it, I enter a 1 to my goal, and Beeminder will start counting down 90 more days before I need to attend my second!
