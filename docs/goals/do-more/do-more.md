Do More goals are the simplest and most straightforward goal type.  They make up 50% of all Beeminder goals (TODO: I made this up.  get the real number).  Chances are high that whatever you want to beemind, you can do it with a Do More!

#### When should I use a Do More?
Use a Do More goal for things you want to do!  They're called Do Mores because usually people want to do the thing *more* often than they already do.  

Common examples: going to the gym, brushing and flossing your teeth, studying for exams, working on your side hustle, saving money, eating your vegetables, crossing items off your to-do list, talking to your family, cleaning your house, doing pushups, eating home-cooked meals, applying for jobs, doing your 10000 daily steps, going to bed before midnight...

Seriously, just about anything works as a do-more, if you enter the data the right way!

#### How should I enter data for a Do More?
Beeminder needs to know how much Whatever you did that day.  Beehind the scenes, it adds up all your datapoints to show you how much Whatever you've done since starting the goal.  

Let's say I have a goal to do more pushups - 100 per week, to bee exact. I did 20 pushups today, I submit a 20 to my graph.  Tomorrow, when I do 30 pushups, I'll submit 30 to my graph.  The next day, I only do 5, so I submit a 5.  And so on.

After those three points have been submitted, the graph will look like this:
(TODO: graph image, probably w/ data on the right)

I'm above my road - doing better than my goal rate!  Cool.  And Beeminder's keeping a running total of all my progress for me, so I know I've done 55 total pushups since starting my goal.

#### I'm going on vacation and won't be working on my Do More goal.  How can I pause it temporarily?
This is super easy to do on a Do More!  Using the 'Take a Break' section in the 'Stop/Pause' tab below the graph, first pick the dates that you'll be away, then set the break rate to 0.  This will make your road flat at that time, so you don't have to make any progress until it starts sloping up again.
(TODO: graph image w/ break)

Note that you probably want the first date of the break to be the day *before* your break begins.  The first date is the last day you'll have to do work before the 0 rate section kicks in.
(TODO: I know it's legacy at this point but can we just fix this so we can axe this section?  it's so easy)
