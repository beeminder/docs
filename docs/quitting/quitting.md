#### What is the 'akrasia horizon'?
A phrase we [coined](http://blog.beeminder.com/dial/) that means "you can't make your goal easier any earlier than 7 days from today."  Some examples of settings that make the goal easier: 
  - changing the goal parameters
  - quitting the goal by archiving it
  - lowering the amount of money at stake
  
Taking any of those actions starts a 7-day countdown, which you can cancel anytime if you change your mind.  When the countdown completes, the change to your goal is made!

#### How do I quit my goal?
In the 'Stop/Pause' tab below the graph, click the 'Archive Goal' button.  This will start a 7-day countdown, after which your goal will be archived and no longer active.  Until the countdown completes, your goal is still active, and you can derail on it!

You can cancel the archive any time during the countdown by pressing the 'Cancel Archive' button (in the same section).

#### What happens after the goal is archived?
Even though it's no longer active, you can still access the goal and data at the same URL.  If you want to restart the goal later, you can do that with the 'Restart Goal' button on the goal page.

#### How do I delete a goal?
You can delete an archived goal immediately if a derailment charge is not pending, using the 'Delete Goal' button on the goal page.

If the goal is not archived and was created less than 7 days ago, you can delete it immediately using the button in the 'Stop/Pause' tab below the graph.

If the goal is not archived and was created more than 7 days ago, you'll need to archive the goal first!

#### How do I delete my account?
If your account was created less than 7 days ago or does not have any active goals, you can delete your account immediately using the button in 'Account Settings' in the top navigation dropdown.  

Otherwise, contact support.  Yes, we intentionally make it a little more work to do this, because the whole point of Beeminder is to get you to stick to your goals!
