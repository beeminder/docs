things like emails and beemails and goal defaults and stuff you probably want to understand before you go creating 17 goals and needing to change everything

#### Why can't I delete my account?
Beeminder is all about keeping you committed to your goals!  So if you have active goals, you'll need to end those first (via archiving, or using the road dial to dial in an end date or goal value) before the option to delete your account is enabled.  This can take up to 7 days, due to the akrasia horizon limitations on making your goal easier.

#### What are the 'new goal defaults'?
These are a few default settings that get applied to every new goal you create.  You can change the settings after creating the goal, of course.  The three defaults you can set are:
  - no-mercy recommits on or off
  - auto-increasing pledges on or off
  - private goals on or off
