So you just joined Beeminder.  Welcome!  :tada:  Here's what you should do first.

#### 1. Make sure everything looks good in your [account settings](account-settings.md).
  - We should infer your [timezone](https://www.beeminder.com/settings/account#account-details) at signup, but make sure we got it right - it impacts your goal deadlines!
  - Take a quick look at the [new goal defaults](https://www.beeminder.com/settings/account#defaults) and set them to what you'd like.  This way you don't have to redo anything after you've created all your goals.
  - If you're going to use any autodata goals, you can go ahead and preemptively add your authorizations [here](https://www.beeminder.com/settings/account#account-permissions) to speed up goal creation.
  
#### 2. [Create a new goal or many new goals!](https://www.beeminder.com/new)
  - Check out the common goals (TODO: make this bucket and link it) guide for instructions and/or inspiration.  You can also dig into the goal types [documentation](../goals/goals.md) for the deep nitty-gritty details on how the beebrain works.
  - [Subscribers](https://www.beeminder.com/premium) have access to a few more goal types.
  - You can delete goals for 7 days after creation, so feel free to experiment, break things, change your mind - it's all undone by the delete button.
  
#### 3. Decide how often you want us to [remind](../reminders/reminders.md) you about the goal.
  - Visit your [reminder settings](https://www.beeminder.com/reminders) to adjust how often and through what channels we bug you about your new goal(s).  If you just created 10 new goals, you'll probably want to stagger those times so we're not blowing your inbox up a few times a day!
  - We'll send you a reminder (ha) email about this 24 hours after making the goal, too.
  
#### 4. Check out the [featured](https://www.beeminder.com/featured) goals and the [forum](https://forum.beeminder.com) for more inspiration.

#### 5. Read the rest of this documentation! 
  - I worked really really hard on it, you guys.
