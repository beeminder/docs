#### What can I beemind with Todoist?
You can track non-recurring todos for one or more labels.

#### I checked off my tasks, but they aren't counting toward my Beeminder goal.
If they're recurring tasks, this is a known limitation of the current Beeminder integration.  [Let us know](https://www.beeminder.com/contact) if this is something you want really badly!

If the tasks are non-recurring, they may not appear if your goal is minding a specific label(s) that isn't attached to that task.
