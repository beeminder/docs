type, deadline, points aren't synced properly, does anyone beemind this anymore after they started charging?

#### What can I beemind with CodeSchool?
Beeminder will track your points accumulated across all classes.  

#### Beeminder isn't updating, even though I've completed courses!
This is a known CodeSchool issue where points for certain courses may not bee reflected on your account.  You can contact CodeSchool support to manually sync your points, after which Beeminder will bee able to fetch the complete total. (TODO: link to support thread)
