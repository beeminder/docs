#### What can I beemind with Habitica?
Beeminder can fetch your to-dos.  You can set a goal to increase them (i.e. complete more todos) or decrease them (i.e. reduce number of undone to-dos).

If you'd like to beemind your dailies, [contact support](https://www.beeminder.com/contact) and let us know!

#### Why isn't Beeminder recognizing to-dos that I'm completing?
Beeminder ignores all to-dos that are part of a challenge.  The challenge owner can change or remove them at any time, which may derail your goal without your consent!  We chose to limit it to your own to-dos so that you have complete control over the data that Beeminder fetches for your goal.
