#### What can I beemind with Withings?
You can beemind your weight, in kilograms or pounds.  

Occasionally people want to beemind body fat percentage.  We're not huge fans of that metric, but we can set up the goal for you if you want.  Just create a weight goal, then contact support!

#### Do I need to weigh in every day?
Nope, the only day it matters is your emergency day.  We think it's incredibly *helpful* and will help you succeed faster if you weigh in daily, but it's not required.

#### I deleted my datapoint in Beeminder, but it came back!
Any deleted or edited datapoints in the last 7 days will be replaced with Withings's value.  If this data is incorrect for any reason, you'll need to modify it in Withings directly or contact Beeminder support for a workaround.

#### Someone else stepped on my scale, and now I have a bad datapoint in my graph!
Delete both the weigh-in in your Withings account and the datapoint in Beeminder.

#### How much Withings history does Beeminder access?
When you create the goal, we'll import all the available weight data, but your graph will only show starting on the goal creation date.  

#### My weight looks like it's reporting in kg, but I want it in lbs (or vice versa).
Contact support and we'll fix it for you.
