#### What can I beemind with Runkeeper?
A whole lot, actually!  

You can choose any combination of Run, Walk, Cycle, and Swim activities to track, and you can measure them in miles, kilometers, times (i.e. number of times you went running), minutes, hours, or calories.

#### Can I change the activities or units I picked after I create the goal?
Units, no.

Activities, yes.  In the 'Settings' tab below the graph image on the goal page, you can pick and choose the included activities in the 'Runkeeper Activities' section.  (TODO: is that what it's called)  This will not rewrite any goal history; it will only change the activities that Beeminder looks for in the future.

#### I did an activity earlier, but Beeminder isn't showing it.
There are a few possible reasons for this:
  - your goal is tracking a certain activity(ies), but the missing activity is categorized differently
  - the activity has not finished syncing from your device to Runkeeper
  - you're heavily editing the Beeminder automatic datapoint comments (to probably resolve this issue, don't delete the Beeminder comment)
  
If none of those solve the problem and/or your goal has derailed because of it, contact us in support!
