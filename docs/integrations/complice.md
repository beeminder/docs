[Complice](https://www.complice.co) is the Qualified Self to Beeminder's Quantified Self.  One might work better for you than the other, or you'll become an unstoppable productivity machine by using both!  We've written a few blog posts featuring Complice & the integration - you can read more [here](http://blog.beeminder.com/complice/), [here](http://blog.beeminder.com/beemplice/), and [here](http://blog.beeminder.com/arbeetrary/).

If you're already a Complice user, go [here](https://complice.co/apps/beeminder) for more detail and to get started.

#### What's an "arbitrary" metric?
(Almost) whatever you want it to bee!  Maybe you want to complete a certain number of "documentation" outcomes per week, but you've also got other non-documentation-related outcomes.  Use the arbitrary things integration to send _only_ completed documentation-related outcomes to a particular Beeminder goal.  

More explanation & examples from Malcolm himself in [this](http://blog.beeminder.com/arbeetrary/) brilliantly-detailed blog post.  If you've used [IFTTT](ifttt.md) and/or the Beeminder IFTTT macros to glue anything together before, it's similar to that - without having to bring in IFTTT as a third-party!

#### How does my Complice data sync to Beeminder?
Beeminder receives updates to your goal directly from Complice when you check off tasks or complete pomodoros.  

If you're beeminding outcome count, that won't get sent until you've submitted outcomes for the day.  So if you don't do it before your deadline, your goal will derail, even if you've been checking off tasks all day!  Just submit those outcomes & contact Beeminder support so we can undo your derailment.

#### I submitted my data in Complice, but my Beeminder goal still derailed!
Contact Beeminder to get your derailment undone, and let Malcolm know about the missing Complice data!
