#### What can I beemind with URLminder?
URLminder will fetch the word count of one or more URLs on the web.  Most users use Google Docs or Dropbox to host their writing, but any plain text, publicly-accessible link will do.

#### The datapoint from URLminder is way different than my actual word count.
The most common cause is that the link chosen is not a plain text link, and Beeminder is counting the page markup as words you've written.  

#### Can I change the URLs used once I've started the goal?
Yup!  In the 'Settings' tab below the graph, add or remove the URLs in the 'URL List' section, then click the 'Update' button to save the changes.

**Bee careful** when removing links - these are [Odometer](../goals/odometer/odometer.md) goals and a sudden drop in word count may send you below the road to an emergency day!  

To get a completely fresh start, remove all documents from URLminder, then refetch the data so that a 0 datapoint is entered.  This will reset the odometer, so you can add a new URL and the smaller word count won't derail your goal!
