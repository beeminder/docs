#### What can I beemind with Garmin?
It varies based on your device! (TODO: why)
  - For Vivoki/Vivofit devices, you can track steps or hours of sleep
  - For all other devices, you can track total distance (in miles or km) or total time in activity
  
#### Why isn't my activity showing up in Beeminder?
First, double-check that the activity is synced and shows up in Garmin Connect - that's where Beeminder fetches its data from.  If there's still a discrepancy in the total between Beeminder and Garmin, contact Beeminder support and we'll investigate.
