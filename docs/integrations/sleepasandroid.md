#### What can I beemind with Sleep as Android?
Sleep duration in hours.

The most frequent additional requests are bedtime and wakeup time.  If you're dying to have either of these or if there's another metric that you'd love to have, let us know!

#### How much data does Beeminder import?
Beeminder does not import any historical sleep data from before you started your goal, but it should fetch all sleeps after that.

#### Why aren't my last sleeps showing up in Beeminder?
First, double-check that they have been synced to the SleepCloud.  If they're not showing there, Beeminder can't pick them up.

Second, try removing and reauthorizing your Google account [here](https://www.beeminder.com/settings/account#account-permissions).  (You should also see a blue error banner on your goal page if your authorization has expired.)

#### One specific day's sleep is not showing up in Beeminder.
You may notice sleep data 'off' by one day when comparing Beeminder & the SleepCloud.  Beeminder marks the data for the day you went to sleep on, while the SleepCloud marks it as the day you woke up on.  (TODO: double-check that this is true) Compare the sleep duration and start time values to see if a day mismatch solves the missing data mystery.

If you still think a sleep is missing, contact support and send us a screenshot of what you're seeing that we aren't picking up!

#### I'm going to derail tonight, but I'll be sleeping long enough tonight to get back on the road!
Not a problem!  Just make sure your sleep data syncs in the morning, reply to the legitimacy check email, and support will fix up your derailment.
