#### Do I need to sync my Fitbit every day?
When Beeminder checks for data, we'll look at the last 7 days of Fitbit data and update any datapoints that are out of sync with Fitbit.  No worries about going off the grid and not syncing for a weekend - you will automatically be caught up when you return and sync your weekend steps.

If you have derailed because you didn't sync in time, no problem.  Just sync the data and contact support to have your derailment undone!

#### I deleted my datapoint in Beeminder, but it came back!
Because of the 7-day lookback, any deleted or edited datapoints will be replaced with Fitbit's value for the day.  If this data is incorrect for any reason, you'll need to modify it in Fitbit directly or contact Beeminder support for a workaround.  

#### How much Fitbit history does Beeminder access?
When you create the goal, we'll import all the available data for that metric, but your graph will only show starting on the goal creation date.  

#### I'm doing steps, but they don't seem to show up on the right day in Beeminder.
Double-check that your Fitbit timezone and your Beeminder timezone are correct and in alignment.
