what is a derailment, how do i get it fixed, when does it happen 

#### What exactly is a 'derailment'?
A derailment occurs when you've fallen off the yellow brick road of your graph.  This means that you're not achieving your goal at the rate you've chosen.

#### When does a derailment happen?
At your deadline, the end of each day.  This defaults to midnight, but can be adjusted for most goals in the reminder settings.

#### I just derailed in the middle of the day!  Help?
Yes, this can happen.  Most of the time it's because historical data has been edited, deleted, or the road has been modified in a way such that you are no longer on track.  If the derailment is not legitimate, email support and we'll get things straightened out, as always!

#### Why do you keep using this word "legitimate"?  What's a "legit" derail?
We only want to charge you when you are *intentionally* choosing *not* to do your goal.  You saw our reminders, you decided that you really don't feel like going to the gym tonight, so your goal derailed, and then we charge you for it.

If you actually did go to the gym, but you forgot to tell Beeminder, that's not legit!  Reply to the legitimacy check email to let us know.  If you've contracted chicken pox and are not allowed to leave the house, you certainly can't go to the gym, so that's also not legit!  Reply to the legitimacy check email to let us know.  And so on.

#### How do you know I'm not lying when I say it's not legit?
We don't, really.  We'll always believe your excuse (or at least pretend to) and undo the derailment.  But you're probably not going to get a lot of value out of Beeminder if you're frequently derailing on goals and sending us weaselly excuses about it to avoid paying up.  That's totally cool, though - we're not the [only](http://blog.beeminder.com/competitors/) [game](http://blog.beeminder.com/trackhack/) in town, and there might be an app out there that suits you and your motivation style better :)

If you want us to be extra-uptight, you can tick the 'weaselproof me' option in your goal settings.  If you derail on a weaselproofed goal, we'll ask for some proof of your excuse or tell you to make your excuse public.  Informing your 1500 Twitter followers that you're weaseling out of a Beeminder goal might be incentive enough to not weasel!

#### What happens when I derail?
Beeminder will send you an email called the "legitimacy check" that lets you know you've derailed, how much we're charging you, and what your post-derailment pledge level is.  If the derailment was an accident, just reply to that email to let us know, and we'll get it fixed up!  After 24 hours have passed, the derailment charge is processed.

We reset the graph, starting at your current data value and heading toward the same goal as before.  We'll also put in a 7-day break period on the goal.  If you decide that the goal was a little too ambitious, or maybe the goal is not something you want to pursue anymore, you should make those changes shortly after derailing.  Since they take 7 days to take effect, the break gives you time for them to kick in before you'll need to start working on the goal again.

(TODO: I kind of want to call this a 9-day break period, because that's what it really is.  #YBHP)

#### What if I want to get back to work immediately after a derailment?
You can enable the 'no-mercy' option in your goal settings to turn off the 7-day post-derailment break.  You'll still get 2 days off before you need to start working again.  And if you *really* want to get going again, you can contact support and we'll put you right back on an emergency day.
